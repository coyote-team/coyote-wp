# Todo

## Priority

* create remote coyote resource
* link resources to posts
* query existing resource by organization ID and source\_uri
* send figcaption along with newly created resource

## Eventually

* sweep existing posts for resources on plugin activation

## Potentially

* support batch resource creation and querying 
* create new post revision on successful update
