The Coyote WordPress plugin allows for images in posts and pages to have their text description ("alt attribute") be managed by a Coyote (https://coyote.pics) service.

== Description ==

When the plugin is installed and its filters are enabled, it replaces image alt attributes in your posts with those retrieved from a Coyote service.
When Coyote service moderators change image descriptions and remote updates are enabled, those filters will also reflect these updates.
